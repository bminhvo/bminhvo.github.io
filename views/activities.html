                        <p class="midnight-blue"><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-large midnight-blue"></i>2011 - Present</p>
                        <p>I was the captain for FLSS Class of 2014 Varsity Soccer Team.</p>
                        <p>As high schools in Vietnam did not have a proper system of organization and coaches for varsity teams, I was the one who took care of everything in the team.</p>
                        <p>From August to October 2011, we played a few games together but had not really formed a real team yet. 
                        After getting advices from the juniors and seniors, I officially created the team of the Class of 2014 in October, 2011.</p>
                        <p>I, with the help of two vice-captains, invited opponents and created friendly match events to prepare for the important competitions we were going to attend in our future high school years. 
                        I was also the main person to come up with the formation, line-up, strategy, and tactics for each game.
                        After graduation, the team still stayed together and competed in several competitions.</p>
                        <p>Other than that, I also helped organize the high school's soccer cup between classes. I was able to develop teamwork as well as leadership skills from being the captain of the soccer team.</p>

                        <p class="midnight-blue"><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-large midnight-blue"></i>2011 - 2014</p>
                        <p>My high school dance club's name is CNN Dance Club as the school's name in Vietnamese is Chuyên Ngoại Ngữ (CNN). CDC can be described as a place where FLSS students can join to explore their passions and develop their skills for dancing.
                        CDC had a total of 4 teams/categories: popping, c-walk, hip-hop, and break-dancing. Other than the president who comes up with showcase ideas and specific development plans for the club, CDC also has leader(s) to manage each team/category.</p>
                        <p>I first joined the popping team of the school's dance club in my freshman year. In the first year, I practiced popping and was chosen by the leaders to perform in many of the club's showcases.
                        After the freshman year, the former leaders voted me to be one of the three new leaders for the popping team.</p>
                        <p>I, together with the other two leaders, organized and taught other members of the team how to practice popping.
                        We also choreographed and chose the members to perform for the club's showcases. CDC helped me develop my passions for dancing in general and for popping in particular.
                        I also learned a lot about organization and management by working closely with the president and other leaders of the popping team.</p>

                        <p class="midnight-blue"><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-large midnight-blue"></i>2012</p>
                        <p>Annually at the beginning of school year, the orientation program started at 7 a.m. and closed at 10.30 p.m. on the same day. 
                        The purpose of the program was to inform new students about the school, student bodies and types of activities all year round. 
                        Older student generations will teach them many crucial skills such as teamwork, public speaking skills, independence and how to build confidence.
                        Teachers want students to be able to develop their personality and strengths, while also emerging themselves in the colorful student culture here at Foreign Language Specialized School. 
                        When the previous Ten Plus generation have already become familiar with the school, they themselves can have the chance of becoming the new guides (more commonly referred to as Orientation Group Leaders or OGL) for the next freshmen year.
                        Freshmen can truly feel comfortable learning and making progress at their new school and students from different academic years can develop strong solidarity. 
                        [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Language_Specialized_School#Ten_Plus_(10+)" target="_blank">FLSS Wikipedia Page</a>]</p>
                        <p>After passing the interview round to be an OGL for Ten Plus 2012, each OGL was assigned to an Orientation Group (OG) of around 8 OGLs.
                        Within my group, the other OGLs voted me to be the OG Head, who was the person to take charge of the OG. OGLs also had to go through an intense period (1 to 2 months) of training and a dry-run day 
                        to make sure that the program would achieve its purpose. My group was then assigned 22 freshmen more than a week before the day of the program.</p>
                        <p>We held meetings and talks with the new students to get to know each other with one week left. Everything was carried out successfully for Ten Plus 2012.
                        By joining the program, OGLs, including me, got the chance to bring the freshmen closer to the school's outstanding characteristics and goals.
                        Furthermore, we were able to develop our own teamwork, leadership and social communication skills through the experience.

                        <p>After graduating from FLSS and getting into Earlham College, I decided to stop playing varsity soccer in order to focus on my studying.
                        I still got the chance to play soccer and meet new people who share the same passion thanks to the school's intramural soccer system.</p>
                        <p>Every semester, Earlham organizes an intramural soccer league for students. The students register the teams themselves and
                        compete with each other for the first place. I have participated in the league every semester so far.
                        As said above, I got the chance to meet new people and develop my teamwork skills by taking part in the activity.</p>

                        <p>Dance Alloy is a student-run, student-funded organization composed of people from all different dance backgrounds.
                        For at least a decade, Dance Alloy has striven to bring together dancers from all backgrounds to allow individuals to work together as a collective whole. 
                        Dance Alloy's goal is to provide an artistic performance outlet for those interested in expressing themselves through movement.</p>
                        <p>For the same reason as with soccer, I decided to join Dance Alloy as a dancer instead of as a choreographer.
                        Although I did not get to practice and perform my preferred type of dancing, popping, I still valued my experience with Dance Alloy
                        as I got the chance to meet people with other backgrounds.
                        Moreover, I learned about a different type of dancing (hip-hop), which felt like experiencing a new culture to me.</p>
