            <p> After a semester of choosing an appropriate topic and reading about the subject, I have conducted
            an Annotated Bibliography, a Survey Paper, and a Project Proposal. Then, I devised a framework for determining soccer results,
            which can also be applied to other sports. In this project, the statistics used were Home Team, Away Team, Half-time 
            Home Goals, Half-time Away Goals, Home Shots on Target, and Away Shots on Target. Out of the four techniques (Gaussian Naive Bayes,
            Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression), Logistic Regression was the one that had the highest accuracy of 67.62%.
            Currently, I am only using the game-play statistics in this project. This means that predictions can only be made on existing matches
            or that predictions can only be made at half-time. Thus, to improve the model in the future, I will need to manipulate the data
            and extract additional features such as the cumulative points gained and goals difference (goals scored - goals conceded) of a team during the current season
            to actually predict future results before the games take place.

            <p>In this project for the AI & Machine Learning Class, I and my partner worked together to implement a decision tree
            learning algorithm. Other than taking in the input and printing the tree out, we also implemented leave-one-out
            cross-validation to measure test set accuracy of the three given datasets. We followed the algorithm in Artificial Intelligence: 
            A Modern Approach (3rd Edition) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig for our implementation of decision tree.

            <p>This is the first project for the AI & Machine Learning Class. In this pair-programming project, I and my partner 
            implemented a state representation scheme for the current state of the world. We also implemented a transition model 
            which included North, South, East, and West directions. Next, we had to implement a goal test to check if the goal
            had been met. From the given input files (mazes), we implemented 4 algorithms: Depth-first search, Breadth-first search, 
            Greedy best-first serach, and A* search to find the path to the prize(s) in each maze. We followed the 4 algorithms 
            described in Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig for our 
            implementations.

            <p>In the Functional Programming class, I got to learn a totally new and purely functional programming language, 
            which is Haskell. The language avoids state changing and thus, it is different from most common imperative languages such as C/C++, Python, Java, etc.
            Because of that characteristic, it was very challenging to create simple versions of War Card Game and Blackjack in Haskell or in any functional programming languages. 
            We had to learn and make use of I/O in Haskell to get around the obstacle that is immutability.

            <p>This web application functions as a social connector and its primary purpose is to facilitate the connection of
            users who have some certain needs with other users who can fulfil those needs. Hence, users can search for, connect with, 
            and make their requests to other users who may not be within close geographic proximity.
            </p>
            <p>Teal has some features integrated from popular social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. However, it also has certain features that are unique to it. 
            The bulk of the application's framework was built using Rails 4.2.5. PostgreSQL 9.3.15 served as the database system and Bootstrap was used to design the front-end UI.
            </p>
            <p>
            Within the group of five members, we decided to divide the work up so that we could finish the project efficiently. I was assigned the role of a Front-end developer.
            From the prototype/template that we got, my job was to alter and improve the elements of the UI as well as the UX 
            according to our group's planning and the users' feedback. I also partially contributed to the Back-end development of the web application during our pair programming sessions.

            <p>Given Nike product names, this web application collects the prices (among other pieces of data) from amazon.com and nike.com, 
            analyzes it, and presents it for the user to compare the prices on the two websites. The average prices are calculated and visualized
            as a bar chart. Users can also search the results using specific details such as product descriptions, prices or ratings.
            </p>
            <p>The application itself was built with AngularJS and the user interface was designed with Twitter’s Bootstrap. 
            Angular Material was conveniently used to build most of the UI features. D3.js is used to draw the bar chart 
            using the average prices from Nike.com every time a product is searched.
            </p>
            <p>Python modules were used to build the server, scrape the data, and perform the data analysis. The server was implemented with Flask
            and BeautifulSoup was used to scrape data from amazon.com and nike.com. Given a keyword, the bs4 makes search requests to 
            amazon.com and nike.com by passing the keyword as a query string in the URL. It then downloads the returned HTML files and selects from the HTML tree the required HTML 
            elements with certain classes and/or attributes. The selected relevant data is then saved into a JSON file to be used as the model in Angular’s MVC.
            </p>
            <p>
            My role in the group of three members was to implemente Flask and BeautifulSoup
            to scrape data from amazon.com and nike.com based on user’s searches.
            To go into more details, I had to examined the HTML tree and designed a way to select certain tags/attributes to extract data about the products,
            which were saved into a JSON file for other members to use for displaying purposes.
